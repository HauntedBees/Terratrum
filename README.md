# Terratrum
This is basically a Mr. Dr*ller-like, made in Godot, with the intention of being played by me on my phone. It is not done yet so don't worry about it.

# License
AGPLv3 because this code sucks and if you're gonna make it better I want that shit, too.

# Contributions
Hold your horses it is not even close to done yet.

# Credits
Made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). There are some fonts I'm using and there will probably be more stuff I use, too. I'll add appropriate credits once I'm more than like 5% done with the project.
